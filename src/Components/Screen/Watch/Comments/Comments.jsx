Neither i have any programing exprience nor i am from programing background but watching your videos has motivated me so much that I have learnt HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Python Django. Currently, I am working in finance domain with a MNC and have 4 years of experience. Thanks to you that now i am confident enough to change my domain and will soon start to look out for jobs related to full stack developer. üôèüèΩ</p>
